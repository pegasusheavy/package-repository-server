# Security Best Practices

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Keys
- Generate cryptographically secure API keys (minimum 32 bytes)
- Use `openssl rand -hex 32` or equivalent
- Support multiple API keys for key rotation
- Implement constant-time comparison for API keys
- Never log API keys (full or partial)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
- Document API key management procedures

### Key Storage
- Store API keys as environment variables
- Never commit keys to version control
- Use secrets management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Encrypt keys at rest
- Use separate keys per environment
- Implement key backup and recovery procedures

### Access Control
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) where applicable
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Separate read and write permissions
- Audit access logs regularly
- Implement IP allowlisting when appropriate

## Data Security

### Encryption

#### In Transit
- **Use HTTPS/TLS in production** (required)
- Use TLS 1.2 or higher
- Use strong cipher suites
- Implement HSTS headers
- Use Let's Encrypt for automatic certificates
- Renew certificates before expiration

#### At Rest
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use platform encryption (S3 SSE, disk encryption)
- Protect GPG private keys
- Encrypt database backups
- Use encrypted volumes for sensitive data

### GPG Signing
- Auto-generate GPG keys on first run
- Use strong key sizes (4096-bit RSA minimum)
- Protect private keys with filesystem permissions (600)
- Backup GPG keys securely
- Document key recovery procedures
- Sign all repository metadata
- Verify signatures during package installation

## Input Validation

### File Uploads
- Validate file types before processing
- Check file extensions and MIME types
- Limit file sizes to prevent DoS attacks
- Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal
- Scan uploaded files for malware (when possible)
- Validate package metadata before indexing

### Filename Sanitization
- Use `sanitize-filename` crate in Rust
- Remove directory traversal sequences (`..`, `/`, `\`)
- Remove special characters that could cause issues
- Limit filename length
- Validate against expected patterns

### API Input Validation
- Validate all API inputs
- Use type-safe parsing (avoid string manipulation)
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate content-type headers
- Reject requests with invalid parameters
- Implement request size limits

## Dependency Security

### Rust Dependencies
- Run `cargo audit` regularly
- Subscribe to RustSec advisory feed
- Update dependencies for security patches
- Review dependencies before adding
- Minimize dependency count
- Pin dependency versions in Cargo.lock

### Node.js Dependencies
- Run `pnpm audit` regularly
- Update dependencies for security patches
- Review dependencies before adding
- Use `pnpm audit fix` to auto-fix vulnerabilities
- Keep pnpm-lock.yaml in version control
- Use Dependabot or similar for automated updates

### Container Images
- Use official base images from trusted sources
- Scan images with Trivy, Snyk, or similar tools
- Update base images regularly
- Pin base image versions
- Remove unnecessary packages from images
- Use minimal base images (Alpine, distroless)

## Secrets Management

### Environment Variables
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Never hardcode secrets in code
- Document required environment variables
- Use `.env.example` files (without actual secrets)
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

### CI/CD Secrets
- Use CI/CD platform's secret management
- Rotate CI/CD secrets regularly
- Limit secret access to necessary workflows
- Audit secret usage
- Use short-lived credentials when possible

### Kubernetes Secrets
- Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data
- Consider external secrets management (External Secrets Operator)
- Enable encryption at rest for etcd
- Implement RBAC for secret access
- Rotate secrets regularly

## Container Security

### Runtime Security
- Run containers as non-root user
- Use read-only root filesystem when possible
- Drop unnecessary Linux capabilities
- Use security contexts in Kubernetes
- Implement Pod Security Standards
- Use AppArmor or SELinux profiles

### Network Security
- Implement network policies in Kubernetes
- Restrict egress and ingress traffic
- Use service mesh for mutual TLS (optional)
- Segment networks appropriately
- Monitor network traffic

## Logging and Auditing

### Secure Logging
- **Never log sensitive data** (passwords, API keys, tokens)
- Sanitize logs before outputting
- Log authentication attempts
- Log authorization failures
- Log administrative actions
- Implement log integrity protection

### Audit Trail
- Maintain audit logs for:
  - Package uploads/deletions
  - API key usage
  - Administrative actions
  - Authentication failures
- Set log retention policies
- Protect audit logs from tampering
- Review audit logs regularly

## Vulnerability Management

### Scanning
- Scan code with static analysis tools:
  - Rust: `cargo clippy`, `cargo audit`
  - TypeScript: ESLint with security rules
  - Terraform: `tfsec`, `checkov`
  - Docker: `trivy`, `snyk`
- Implement automated scanning in CI/CD
- Fix critical vulnerabilities immediately
- Prioritize high and medium severity issues

### Penetration Testing
- Perform regular security assessments
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Document and fix findings

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- Document incident response procedures
- Define security incident severity levels
- Identify incident response team
- Establish communication channels
- Maintain contact information

### Detection and Response
- Monitor for security incidents
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Investigate security events promptly
- Contain incidents quickly
- Document all incidents
- Conduct post-incident reviews

### Security Updates
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies
- Apply security patches promptly
- Test patches in staging before production
- Document security updates
- Notify users of critical security updates

## Compliance and Standards

### Best Practices
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security training for team
- Keep security documentation updated
- Perform security reviews for major changes

### Data Privacy
- Handle user data responsibly
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide data deletion mechanisms
- Document data handling practices
